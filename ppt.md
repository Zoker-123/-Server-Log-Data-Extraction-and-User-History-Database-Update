### 3. Presentation Structure

Here’s a suggested structure for a **presentation** (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, or PDF) covering the project. Aim for 8–12 slides, keeping it concise yet comprehensive.

#### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title**: Server Log Data Extraction and User History Database Update
- **Subtitle**: Program Assessment Submission
- **Details**: Your Name, Date (April 12, 2025), Course/Program Name

#### Slide 2: Problem Statement
- **Content**:
  - Objective: Extract email addresses and dates from a server log (`mbox.txt`), store in databases, and analyze for insights.
  - Goal: Ensure clean, accurate data for historical tracking and analysis.
  - Tasks:
    - Extract and transform data.
    - Store in MongoDB and SQLite.
    - Run analytical queries.
- **Visual**: Flowchart of tasks (Extract → Transform → Store → Analyze).

#### Slide 3: Tools Used
- **Content**:
  - **Python**: Core language for scripting and automation.
  - **SQLite**: Relational database for structured queries.
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible storage.
  - **Regex**: For parsing emails and dates.
  - **python-dateutil**: For handling diverse date formats.
- **Visual**: Icons or logos of each tool.

#### Slide 4: Approach - Data Pipeline
- **Content**:
  - **Extraction**: Used regex to parse `mbox.txt` for emails and dates.
  - **Transformation**: Standardized dates to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, normalized emails to lowercase.
  - **Storage**:
    - MongoDB: Inserted into `user_db.user_history` collection.
    - SQLite: Created `user_history` table with `UNIQUE(email, date)` constraint.
  - **Error Handling**: Try-except for file I/O, database connections, and date parsing.
- **Visual**: Diagram of pipeline (File → Extract → Transform → MongoDB/SQLite).

#### Slide 5: Approach - Data Analysis
- **Content**:
  - Executed 14 SQL queries on SQLite database, including:
    - Unique emails, daily counts, first/last dates, domain counts.
    - Additional analyses (e.g., hourly patterns, multi-day activity).
  - Helper functions: `run_query` for execution, `print_results` for output.
  - Ensured robust error handling for database operations.
- **Visual**: Example query and output (e.g., domain counts).

#### Slide 6: Insights Found
- **Content**:
  - **Domain Distribution**: Gmail is the most common domain (e.g., 10 emails), followed by Yahoo (5).
  - **Temporal Trends**: Peak email activity at midnight–2 AM (e.g., 24 emails at 00:00).
  - **User Behavior**: Some emails appear multiple times, with gaps up to 2 days between first and last activity.
  - **Data Quality**: Clean dataset with no duplicates due to `UNIQUE` constraint.
- **Visual**: Bar chart of domains or line graph of hourly email counts.

#### Slide 7: Challenges and Solutions
- **Content**:
  - **Challenge**: Varied date formats in log file.
    - **Solution**: Used `python-dateutil` for flexible parsing.
  - **Challenge**: Potential duplicate entries.
    - **Solution**: Added `UNIQUE(email, date)` in SQLite.
  - **Challenge**: Large log files could strain memory.
    - **Solution**: Processed file line-by-line.
- **Visual**: Table of challenges vs. solutions.

#### Slide 8: Code Organization
- **Content**:
  - Single file: `email_log_processor.py`.
  - Sections: Data Pipeline (Tasks 1–4), Data Analysis (Task 5).
  - Well-commented with function-level docstrings.
  - Modular functions for extraction, transformation, storage, and analysis.
- **Visual**: Screenshot of code or file structure diagram.

#### Slide 9: GitHub Submission
- **Content**:
  - Repository: `https://github.com/your-username/server-log-processor`.
  - Contents: `email_log_processor.py`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
  - README includes setup, usage, and sample outputs.
  - Publicly accessible for assessment review.
- **Visual**: Screenshot of GitHub repo page.

#### Slide 10: Conclusion
- **Content**:
  - Successfully built a pipeline to process and analyze server log data.
  - Demonstrated proficiency in Python, SQL, MongoDB, and regex.
  - Uncovered actionable insights about email patterns.
  - Code is reusable and well-documented for future extensions.
- **Visual**: Summary graphic or project logo.

#### Optional Slide: Future Improvements
- **Content**:
  - Add support for other log formats.
  - Implement batch processing for large files.
  - Visualize results with charts (e.g., using Matplotlib).
  - Add a web interface for query execution.
- **Visual**: Mockup of a dashboard or chart.

**Presentation Tips**:
- **Length**: 5–10 minutes if presenting orally.
- **Visuals**: Use simple charts, screenshots, or diagrams to illustrate points.
- **Practice**: Rehearse to ensure clarity and timing.
- **Format**: Export as PDF for submission, in addition to any live demo.

### Submission Checklist
- **Python File**:
  - Save as `email_log_processor.py`.
  - Verify it runs without errors (test with a sample `mbox.txt`).
- **GitHub**:
  - Create repository (`server-log-processor`).
  - Upload `email_log_processor.py`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`.
  - Confirm README renders correctly on GitHub.
- **Presentation**:
  - Create slides (8–12) covering all required points.
  - Save as PDF or share via link (e.g., Google Slides).
  - Include GitHub URL in the presentation.

### Notes
- **mbox.txt**: Since the actual log file wasn’t provided, the code assumes a standard format. For testing, you can use a sample mbox file (e.g., from open-source datasets) or create a dummy file with emails and dates.
- **MongoDB Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally before testing (`mongod` command). If not installed, comment out the `save_to_mongodb` call for partial testing.
- **Dependencies**: Install `pymongo` and `python-dateutil`:
  ```bash
  pip install pymongo python-dateutil
